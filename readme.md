## How to use

Firstly, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhaihj/fca-rust
```

Build the project with `cargo`:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Then you will get two executable files in `./target/release/`. Give it a try:

Generate a random relation sheet with 500 object, 500 attributes and P at 0.1:

```bash
./target/release/generate_random_fca 500 500 0.1 > 500_500_0.1.fc
```

Enumerate all concepts:

```bash
time ./target/release/generate_concept 500_500_0.1.fc
```

You will get: 

```bash

433913 concepts generated.
./target/release/generate_concept 500_500_0.1.fc  4.38s user 0.03s system 99% cpu 4.404 total
```

To see all the enumerated concepts, use `-v` option:

```bash
$ ./target/release/generate_random_fca 15 5 0.3 > 15_5_0.3.fc
$ ./target/release/generate_concept 15_5_0.3.fc -v
